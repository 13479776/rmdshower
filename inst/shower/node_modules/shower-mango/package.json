  "readme": "# Ribbon theme for Shower\n\n![Ribbon screen shot](docs/images/canvas.png)\n\nDefault theme for the [Shower](https://github.com/shower/shower/) presentation engine. Doesn’t include engine itself. [See it in action](http://shwr.me/shower/themes/ribbon/). Follow [@shower_me](https://twitter.com/shower_me) for support and updates, [file an issue](https://github.com/shower/shower/issues/new) if you have any.\n\n## Usage\n\nGet the Shower template where Ribbon is already included. Download the [template archive](http://shwr.me/shower.zip) or install the package:\n\n\tnpm install shower\n\nIf you want to install Ribbon separately you can download the [theme archive](http://shwr.me/ribbon.zip) or install the package:\n\n\tnpm install shower-ribbon\n\nThe same packages available in [bower](http://bower.io/).\n\n## Features\n\nAll theme’s features are demonstrated in the [index.html](index.html) file. Use it as a reference while building your presentation. See more detailed [features overview](docs/features-en.md).\n\n## Ratios\n\nRibbon theme supports two slide ratios: wide 16×10 (default) and taller 4×3. To change the slide’s ratio include one of the pre-built `screen-16x10.css` or `screen-4x3.css` files in the `<head>` of your presentation.\n\n## PDF\n\nRibbon could be exported to PDF by printing it from the list mode in Chrome or Opera browsers. See [printing documentation](docs/printing-en.md) for more options.\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to adjust theme for your needs:\n\n1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.\n2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.\n3. Start a local server with watcher: `npm run dev` or just `gulp` if you have it installed globally.\n4. Edit your files and see changes in the opened browser.\n\nTo take part in Ribbon development please read [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first and [file an issue](https://github.com/shower/shower/issues/new) before sending any pull request.\n\n---\nLicensed under [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\n",
