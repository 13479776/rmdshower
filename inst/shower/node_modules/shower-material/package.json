See more detailed [features overview](https://github.com/shower/shower/blob/master/docs/features-en.md).\n\n## Ratios\n\nMaterial theme supports two slide ratios: wide 16×10 (default) and taller 4×3. To change the slide’s ratio include one of the pre-built `screen-16x10.css` or `screen-4x3.css` files in the `<head>` of your presentation.\n\n## PDF\n\nRibbon could be exported to PDF by printing it from the list mode in Chrome or Opera browsers. See [printing documentation](https://github.com/shower/shower/blob/master/docs/printing-en.md) for more options.\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to adjust theme for your needs:\n\n1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.\n2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.\n3. Start a local server with watcher: `npm run dev` or just `gulp` if you have it installed globally.\n4. Edit your files and see changes in the opened browser.\n\nTo take part in Material development please read [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first and [file an issue](https://github.com/shower/shower/issues/new) before sending any pull request.\n\n---\nLicensed under [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\n",
